üíº C++ Practice Project: Personal Finance & Budget Tracker
üéØ Problem Statement

Create a Personal Finance Tracker in C++ that helps an individual (or client) 
manage their income and expenses, track spending categories, and calculate savings 
or net cash flow.

üß© Features & Requirements

1. Add Transaction

Allow the user to record a new financial transaction.
Each transaction should include:

Description (string)

Category (e.g., ‚ÄúIncome‚Äù, ‚ÄúFood‚Äù, ‚ÄúRent‚Äù, ‚ÄúUtilities‚Äù, ‚ÄúTaxes‚Äù, ‚ÄúInvestments‚Äù)

Amount (double; positive for income, negative for expenses)

Date (string or simple format like ‚ÄúYYYY-MM-DD‚Äù)

üí° Validation: Prevent zero or unrealistic amounts (e.g., > $10 million).

2. Display All Transactions

List all recorded transactions with:

Index number

Description

Category

Amount (show ‚Äú+‚Äù or ‚Äú-‚Äù)

Date

Example:

ID | Description       | Category   | Amount   | Date
------------------------------------------------------
1  | Paycheck          | Income     | +3500.00 | 2025-10-10
2  | Groceries         | Food       | -120.45  | 2025-10-11
3  | Electric Bill     | Utilities  | -80.00   | 2025-10-12

3. Update Transaction

Allow the user to modify an existing record ‚Äî description, category, or amount.

4. Delete Transaction

Remove a transaction by ID or description.

5. Summary Report

Generate a financial summary:

Total Income

Total Expenses

Net Savings / Net Cash Flow

(Optional) Category Breakdown

Example:

===== Monthly Summary =====
Total Income:   $3,500.00
Total Expenses: $1,200.00
Net Savings:    $2,300.00

6. Exit Option

Exit gracefully and thank the user.

üèó Technical Requirements

Use a struct or class called Transaction.

Store transactions in a vector<Transaction>.

Implement a simple text-based menu.

Include input validation.

Write separate functions for:

addTransaction()

displayTransactions()

updateTransaction()

deleteTransaction()

showSummary()
